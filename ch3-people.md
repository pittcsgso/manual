Over the course of the year, the duties of the CS-GSO require interaction with
a number of people.  Sometimes, it's hard to remember what exactly everyone
does.  Other times, those responsibilities just change hands for some reason.

This chapter aims to act as a repository of information about who these people
are and what they do.  It is only as accurate as the updates which have been
made to it.  Keep in mind that much of this document has been written with
various names throughout, and it is possible that those names are out-of-date.
If you encounter a name that seems particularly old and you're really stuck,
run `git log -p` on the source file for this chapter to dig into the history
here.
