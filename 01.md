# January

In early January, double-check with Keena and the tech staff that any **new
students entering for the spring term** have been added to the grad mailing
list.  Until they are, copy them individually on any emails sent to the list.

Talk to Karen to coordinate a date for a **spring Town Hall Meeting** between
the graduate students and the department chair.  Aim for some time in February.
