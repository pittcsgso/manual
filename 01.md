# January

In early January, double-check with Keena and the tech staff that any **new
students entering for the spring term** have been added to the grad mailing
list.  Until they are, copy them individually on any emails sent to the list.

Discuss and finalize dates for **spring social events**, booking rooms with
Karen where necessary.  Typically, the International Luncheon is held sometime
in April, although it may be better to hold it in February when people are less
busy.

Talk to Karen to coordinate a date for a **spring Town Hall Meeting** between
the graduate students and the department chair.  Aim for some time in February.

If conditions warrant, clean the refrigerator and microwave in the Graduate
Lounge (SENSQ 6317).  Pick a day to do this after lunch, around 2:00pm, so as
not to disrupt those who use the space regularly.  A few days prior, send an
email to the grad list and post a notice on the refrigerator about the
scheduled cleaning.  (See instructions in August.)
