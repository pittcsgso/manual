# July

Obtain from Keena the **names and email addresses** of incoming graduate
students entering in the fall; this should be more-or-less finalized by
mid-July.  Be sure to get information for incoming PhD, MS, and BS/MS students
(the last group is often forgotten).

If no one has yet **picked up the shelter permit** for the Welcome Picnic, now
is the time to do so, as you will need to have this permit with you at the
shelter on the day of.  This will generally require visiting the Public Works
Permits Office downtown at 611 Second Ave in person; they are open weekdays
from 7:00am to 3:00pm.

At the Permits Office, you will need to present the check which was issued by
the University and specify which of the available times you want the permit to
be valid.  There isn't much practical difference between the choices, but we
typically choose the 11:00am--7:00pm option, since that gives us plenty of time
to set up for a 1:00pm picnic and tear down after about 3:30pm or so.
