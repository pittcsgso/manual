# August

Create a **Fall Coffee Hour** signup sheet, beginning with the start of fall
classes (that is, the Monday between 25 and 31 August, inclusive), and ending
with the week after fall final exams (that is, the Monday between 15 and 21
December, inclusive).  Keep in mind that Coffee Hour should be moved to Tuesday
when in conflict with the following holidays:

* Labor Day (first Monday of September)
* Fall Holiday (typically second Monday of October; check the Academic Calendar)
