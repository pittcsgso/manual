# August

Create a **Fall Coffee Hour** signup sheet, beginning with the start of fall
classes (that is, the Monday between 25 and 31 August, inclusive), and ending
with the week after fall final exams (that is, the Monday between 15 and 21
December, inclusive).  Keep in mind that Coffee Hour should be moved to Tuesday
when in conflict with the following holidays:

* Labor Day (first Monday of September)
* Fall Holiday (typically second Monday of October; check the Academic Calendar)

Early in the month, determine the **food and supplies budget for the Welcome
Picnic.** Since this is paid for by the department, this should be coordinated
directly with the Department Chair.  Data on past years' purchases and the
resulting leftovers will be more persuasive in the case that a budget increase
may be necessary or desired.

Additionally, coordinate **soda for the Welcome Picnic;** this is usually done
with Deb.  In some years, the department may have a large reserve of soda in
their stockroom, in which case they should let you take from that.  In other
years, their stock may be depleted, in which case the CS-GSO should offer to
purchase some on the department's behalf, although this may require use of the
department's purchasing card (P-card) and coordination with Don.  **In any
case, the department has historically paid for the soda.**

Start individually **copying the new incoming students on emails** to the grad
list in mid-August when topics start shifting toward Orientation Week events
and the picnic.  Double-check with Keena that the list hasn't changed before
sending anything.  Be sure to include all incoming PhD and MS students, as well
as BS/MS students entering the master's program.

Begin **planning any special events** you may wish to hold during the fall
term.  Coordinate with other organizations and book rooms accordingly.
