# December

Create a **Spring Coffee Hour** signup sheet, beginning with the Monday on or
after the reopening of University offices (typically the Monday between 3 and 9
January, inclusive; check the Academic Calendar), and ending with the week of
spring final exams (that is, the Monday between 20 and 26 April, inclusive).
Keep in mind that Coffee Hour should be moved to Tuesday when in conflict with
the following holiday:

* Martin Luther King's Birthday Observance (third Monday of January)

Coffee Hour should be held as normal during Spring Recess.
