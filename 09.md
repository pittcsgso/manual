# September

In early September, shortly after fall classes begin, double-check with the
tech staff to ensure that the **grad mailing list** is up-to-date with all of
the new PhD and MS students, as well as BS/MS students entering the master's
program.  Be especially sure that the BS/MS students haven't been forgotten.
Once everyone has been confirmed added to the list, there is no need to copy
them individually on future messages.

Finalize dates for the **Halloween Party** (typically a weekend evening near 31
October) and the **Holiday Party** (typically the Friday during final exams;
that is the Friday between 12 and 18 December, inclusive).  Talk to Karen to
book the Seminar Room (5317) for both events now, but start looking for
alternative locations for the Halloween Party, as it is preferable to hold that
event off-campus if possible.

Talk to Karen to coordinate a date for a **fall Town Hall Meeting** between the
graduate students and the department chair.  Aim for some time in late October
or early November.
