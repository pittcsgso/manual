# September

In early September, shortly after fall classes begin, double-check with the
tech staff to ensure that the **grad mailing list** is up-to-date with all of
the new PhD, MS, and BS/MS students.  Be especially sure that the BS/MS
students haven't been forgotten.  Once everyone has been confirmed added to the
list, there is no need to copy them individually on future messages.

Talk to Karen to coordinate a date for a **fall Town Hall Meeting** between the
graduate students and the department chair.  Aim for some time in late October
or early November.
