This **Manual of Operations** is meant to assist the officers of the Computer
Science Graduate Student Organization (CS-GSO) at the University of Pittsburgh
with their responsibilities.  It was first created in August 2014 by **Timothy
J Parenti**, President of the CS-GSO, 2013--2015.

It is intended to be a constant reference to future officers of the
organization throughout their terms of office, and to be updated by the same
over the course of the years to accurately reflect any changes to the broader
landscape in which the organization operates, as well as the operational
adjustments which have made to accommodate such changes.

# Editing this manual

**This is a living document.**  By no means does this manual aim to completely
specify everything the CS-GSO does or should do.  The presence of suggestions
herein does not bind future officers to adhere to those practices; likewise,
the absence of an item does not preclude them from taking action on it as they
see fit.  When, inevitably, circumstances dictate that a procedure outlined
herein be changed, this document should be updated accordingly for the benefit
of future boards.

The source files for this manual live in a Git repository at
[https://github.com/pittcsgso/manual](https://github.com/pittcsgso/manual).
It is the responsibility of departing officers of the CS-GSO to ensure that
sufficient access permissions to this repository are given to incoming officers.

Command-line tools for Git are available from
[http://www.git-scm.com/](http://www.git-scm.com/),
as well as through most package managers.  The `Makefile` in this repository
automatically stamps compiled copies of this document with the commit, author,
and date on which it is based.  Be sure to commit changes with `git commit`
before running `make`.
