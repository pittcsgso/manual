To conduct its business, the CS-GSO relies on several physical and digital
assets, as well as access to the areas in which those assets are stored.  This
chapter enumerates the various access mechanisms which should be transferred
upon transition between boards of officers after the conclusion of a term of
office, as well as the assets that are available for use.

# Physical assets, access codes, and keys

CS-GSO has an office in Sennott Square. Currently, all access codes and keys must be obtained from the Financial Administrator. For each room, only one officer in GSO can have the codes and keys in CS department at any time.

Glick office is used by the department for long-term storage. All non-perishable items for CS department should be stored there once we finished using them.
