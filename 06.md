# June

Finalize dates for **social events during Orientation Week**, and book rooms
with Karen where necessary.  Typically, we host a Game Night get-together the
Friday evening before fall classes start, but be aware of other University-wide
events being hosted by GPSG, etc. and try not to conflict.
