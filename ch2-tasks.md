First and foremost, the CS-GSO is responsible to the graduate students of the
Computer Science Department at the University of Pittsburgh.  Although we also
strive to help the undergraduate students, faculty, and staff of the department
whenever possible, this is not our main organizational focus.  This chapter
aims to highlight the scope of the programs and services which the CS-GSO
endeavors to provide to its surrounding academic community.
