# May

Begin **planning any special events** you may wish to hold during the summer
term.  Coordinate with other organizations and book rooms accordingly.

If desired, talk to Karen to coordinate a date for a **summer Town Hall
Meeting** between the graduate students and the department chair.  Aim for some
time in June.  (Summer term is the least necessary time for a Town Hall
Meeting, and there may not be sufficient interest for it to be worthwhile.)
