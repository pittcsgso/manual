While adequate representation in student government is important, equally
important to the well-being of graduate students in the CS Department are the
social outlets the CS-GSO provides to its students on an ongoing basis.  This
chapter aims to highlight the scope of the programs and services which the
CS-GSO endeavors to provide to its surrounding academic community.

# Coffee Hour

By far the most visible social event organized by the CS-GSO is the weekly
Coffee Hour.  It aims to support the learning community of graduate students,
faculty, and staff by allowing them to socialize in an informal setting, apart
from their studies and day-to-day responsibilities.

Traditionally, Coffee Hour is held in the Faculty Lounge (6323) weekly on
Mondays from 3:30--4:30pm, although this is moved to Tuesday in the event of a
University holiday or the GPSG graduate and professional student orientation in
August.  Coffee Hour is held every week throughout the year, except over the
winter holidays.

Signups are held for volunteers to bring food and drink on a weekly basis.
Signup sheets should be prepared in advance of each academic term.  Weekly
signin sheets are also needed for reimbursement verification purposes.  Past
signup and signin sheets can be found in `docs/coffeehour`.

The department provides up to $25.00 in reimbursement to each week's
host.  The department also provides coffee, coffee filters, cups, plates,
napkins, and plasticware.  Detailed instructions for hosts are posted online at
[http://gso.cs.pitt.edu/coffeehour/directions.php](http://gso.cs.pitt.edu/coffeehour/directions.php).

CS-GSO officers should offer assistance to Coffee Hour hosts in any setup or
cleanup as needed.  The President should send a reminder email to each host on
the Friday prior to their scheduled week, such as the following:

	Michael,

	Just a reminder that you're scheduled to host Coffee Hour this Monday, 4
	August 2014, at 3:30pm in the Faculty Lounge (6323).  The budget is $25.00;
	after the event, your itemized receipts go to Michele in 5113 for
	reimbursement.

	Please see a workstudy in the Main Office (6135) around 3:00 or 3:15pm to
	get into the Faculty Lounge to set up.  I'll bring you the sign-in and
	sign-up sheets around that time.  If you need detailed instructions, you
	can find them at http://gso.cs.pitt.edu/coffeehour/directions.php

	Thanks for volunteering!  Please acknowledge this message and let me know
	if I can give you a hand with anything.
