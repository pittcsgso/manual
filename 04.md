# April

Create a **Summer Coffee Hour** signup sheet, beginning with the week after
spring final exams (that is, the Monday between 27 April and 3 May, inclusive),
and ending with the week before the start of fall classes (that is, the Monday
between 18 and 24 August, inclusive).  Keep in mind that Coffee Hour should be
moved to Tuesday when in conflict with the following holidays or events:

* Memorial Day (last Monday of May)
* Independence Day, if necessary (observed 4 July unless on a weekend; check
  Academic Calendar)
* GPSG graduate and professional student orientation (typically the Monday
  before the start of fall classes)

Although the term of office is nearly complete, **consider any special events**
that are desired for the summer term.  Check in with the potential candidates
for next year's CS-GSO board for buy-in, then begin coordinating with other
organizations and book rooms accordingly.  Don't saddle the incoming board with
events they won't want to follow through on, but try not to leave them with
nothing, either.  Ideally, departing officers would help with these events in
some capacity, to the extent that they are able.
