# April

Create a **Summer Coffee Hour** signup sheet, beginning with the week after
spring final exams (that is, the Monday between 27 April and 3 May, inclusive),
and ending with the week before the start of fall classes (that is, the Monday
between 18 and 24 August, inclusive).  Keep in mind that Coffee Hour should be
moved to Tuesday when in conflict with the following holidays or events:

* Memorial Day (last Monday of May)
* Independence Day, if necessary (observed 4 July unless on a weekend; check
  Academic Calendar)
* GPSG graduate and professional student orientation (typically the Monday
  before the start of fall classes)
